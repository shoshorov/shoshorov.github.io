project-description: | 
  RULER is an approach to social and emotional learning (SEL) that teaches emotional intelligence to people of all ages, with the goal of creating a healthier, more equitable, innovative, and compassionate society. 

  As the goal of RULER is to make the approach an enduring part of your schoolâ€™s culture, RULER is introduced in phases. RULER adoption begins with staff personal and professional learning, and continues with classroom instruction for students, and family engagement and education.
