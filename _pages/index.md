      Today’s construction projects are too complex and dynamic for yesterday’s methods. Move beyond outdated centralized critical path method schedules, spend-based progress calculations, home-grown spreadsheet trackers and productivity initiatives.

      Take control, real control of project outcomes throughout all phases of a project from early concept through construction and handover with SPS Project Production Control. Capture data and make decisions at the speed of relevance.

      Harness the power of real-time distributed planning and control (not controls) using Operations Science and IoT-enabled cloud-based computing. No more driving using the rearview mirror with outdated reporting and forecasting - understand and control critical success factors such as work sequence, work-in-process, and capacity utilization to influence project outcomes.

      Late and wrong material deliveries drive construction crews to wait, slow down or work out of sequence, all of which result in increased cost and schedule delays. However, due to the need to handle, store, and preserve materials along with risk of damage, theft, and obsolescence, too much material onsite also increases cost and use of cash. Both scenarios increase risk of environmental, health and safety incidents.

      Unlike conventional approaches that attempt to schedule deliveries and ultimately result in dedicated teams of people expediting and tracking using various spreadsheets, SPS Supply Flow Control integrates Operations Science with cloud-based software to create an operational digital twin of the supply chain enabling absolute control and transparency of material flow through the supply chain. 

      #### Enable Real Time Location and Environment with IoT

      Monitor the flow of materials in real-time using existing data feeds including cellular, satellite, WiFi, and other communications platforms. Perform scenario analysis using real time location feeds connected to demand requirements.

      #### Identify Opportunities to Improve Reliability while Reducing Cost and Cycle Time

      Apply Operations Science algorithms and simulation methods to analyze and simulate supply chain performance.

      #### Improve Performance with Analytics

      Leverage automated supply specific analytics including cycle time, work-in-process, capacity utilization, etc. to continuously improve reliability and reduce cost of supply.

      The ability to design and optimize a production system, whether at a construction site, in a fabrication shop or throughout a total project network, drives customer satisfaction, cost, and profitability. Too much inventory of work and stocks results in unnecessary cost and use of cash, while not enough inventory of work and stocks causes cost of labor, equipment, and space to increase.

      SPS Production System Optimization tools enable customers to effectively map, model, simulate, analyze, and optimize workflows associated with design, fabrication, logistics and construction/commissioning.

      They are also used to optimize core operations and processes for virtually any form of production from manufacturing and processing to service-based production systems including design offices, shipyards, maintenance crews, etc.
